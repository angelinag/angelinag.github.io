I"<h4 id="with-this-blog-im-aiming-to-help-others-but-not-only">With this blog, Iâ€™m aiming to help others. But not onlyâ€¦</h4>

<p>In fact, I realised Iâ€™ve come to a point in my career where I have to come up with solutions for more complex problems.</p>

<p>Therefore, it happens that sometimes later on I need these lengthy solutions again, and instead of reinventing the wheel, 
Iâ€™d rather just take a look here.</p>

<p>So this doesnâ€™t just serve the purpose of a blog; it is rather a collection of stuff I spent so much time on, Iâ€™d rather
have saved somewhere. And why not let others see it as well, just in the meantime?</p>
